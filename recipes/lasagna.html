    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbled; drain excess grease. Stir in olives and water; season with minced garlic, oregano, onion flakes, garlic powder, pepper, sage, and basil. Simmer, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Spoon a layer of meat and sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over noodles; sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce; repeat layering, ending with meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes. Lasagna is cooked when it's easily pierced with a knife. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella cheese over lasagna and bake until melted, about 10 minutes more.</p></li>
